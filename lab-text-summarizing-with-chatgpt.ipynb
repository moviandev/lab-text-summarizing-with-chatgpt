    "After running these three prompts (and perhaps others you invent), you should analyze the outputs and structure your findings into a brief report. A good one-page report should include these sections:1. Introduction & MethodologyGoal: Briefly state the exercise's goal (testing prompt engineering for targeted text summarization/extraction using an LLM).Method: Mention the base text (prod_review), the model used (gpt-3.5-turbo), and that three distinct prompts were tested to focus on different departments/goals (e.g., Product Design, Marketing, Social Media).2. Analysis of Prompt VariationsCreate a small table or list for each prompt, detailing:Prompt FocusPrimary ConstraintSummary of Model OutputSuccess/FailureV1: Product DesignSingle sentence, focus on features/quality(Insert the actual output)Did it successfully exclude price/shipping?V2: Marketing (Positive Extraction)Bulleted list, positive points only(Insert the actual output)Did it successfully filter out the negative/neutral points?V3: Social Media HeadlineTwo lines, informal tone, emojis(Insert the actual output)Did it adhere to the length/style constraint?3. Key Findings: What Worked and What Didn't?Successful Strategies: Discuss which instructions the model followed well (e.g., word count limits, required output format like a bullet list, focusing on a specific topic like \"features\").Areas That Didn't Work Well (Hallucinations/Errors):Did the model include irrelevant information despite a strong focus instruction? (e.g., including shipping in the Product Design summary).Did it add details not present in the original review (a hallucination)?Did it fail to meet a strict constraint (e.g., giving four bullet points instead of three)?4. Conclusion & Lessons LearnedOverall Lesson: Summarize your main takeaway. For example, \"I learned that using 'extract' is often better than 'summarize' when you need strictly departmental feedback, and that explicitly stating the intended audience or goal helps the model select the right tone and focus.\"Refinement: Suggest a modification to one of the prompts to improve the outcome.Would you like me to put one of these creative prompt versions into a full, runnable code cell you can copy and paste to start the exercise?"
